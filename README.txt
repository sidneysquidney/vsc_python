A python program that you can play naughts and crosses on. 

By running the programme you will be prompted to input your choice of opponent, whether or not you go first, if computer, the computers level etc. 

I think the coding is fairly robust. There are no advanced algorithms, so this is perhaps room for improvement. All the computer decisions are made by a control flow as its options are in a small enough window to manage. 

Any comments or ways to better implement I'd be happy to hear.
